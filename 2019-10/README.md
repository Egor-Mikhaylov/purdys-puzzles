## October 2019 Puzzle

A [Mersenne prime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mersenne_prime#List_of_known_Mersenne_primes) is a prime number that is one less than a power of two, ie. 2<sup>n</sup> - 1.  The exponents that give Mersenne primes are 2, 3, 5, 7, 13, 17, 19, 31, ... and the resulting primes are 3, 7, 31, 127, 8191, 131071, 524287, 2147483647, ...

Analyzing 8191, we can see that there are two pairs of digits that sum to 10: 1 and 9; 9 and 1.

In 131071, there is only one pair: 3 and 7

524287 again has 2 pairs: 2 and 8; 2 and 8

2147483647 has 6 pairs: 2,8; 4,6; 7,3; 4,6; 3,7; 6,4

### Question:
