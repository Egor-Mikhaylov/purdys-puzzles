# December 2019 Puzzle

Mr. Purdy is hanging Christmas Lights at his house.  The bulbs come in 5 colors: Red, Orange, Green, Blue, and Purple.  He purchased the same number of each color, but all of the bulbs have been thrown into a large box and have gotten mixed up.  He decides to start putting the bulbs up without regard to their order but makes a list of the colors as he hangs them.  After a while, he notices that every once in a while, there is a cluster of 5 bulbs with each of the 5 colors.  He begins to wonder how many times this happened.  Unfortunately, he has already finished the job!

He goes back and examines the first 15 bulbs `GGPORBOBGORPROG` and notices that it happens twice: `GPORB` and `BGORP`.

After a few more minutes of analysis, he sees that in the first hundred bulbs, it happened 4 times.

He spends the rest of the day counting bulbs and discovers that in the first thousand bulbs, all 5 colors are clustered 29 times.  

Mr. Purdy's list of all one million bulbs that he hung is in [bulbs.txt](bulbs.txt).  How many clusters of 5 different colors (without overlap) are there in all?


### Clarifying "without overlap"
This set of 10 bulbs `RGOPBRGOPB` would only be considered as 2 clusters of five different colors.
